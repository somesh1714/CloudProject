Note: Read and Understand the Virtual network embedding(VNE) problem statement.


S1.Download P3_ALIB_MASTER unzip copy to C Drive or Where the project is existing Note: P3_ALIB_MASTER\input contain pickle files. Ex: senario_RedBestel.pickle
Note: Excluding VtlWavenet2011_KK_ARNER_2.pickle file, all other pickle file conatin Single Substrate Network information but this one contain Two Substrate network information one is KK_Aarnet and other one is VtlWavenet2011 network(WE cann multiple substrate networks), but while uing this we need to establish the connection between two randomely.
S2. In vne.py: 
a. We can mention reuiremnets of VNRs like minimum and Maximum number of nodes.
Total number of reuests in create_vne Function.

b. WE can set the virtual network requests demand like BandWidth(1,n) ,CRB(CPU)(1,10), Location(0,100),Delay(1,4) in vne.append function. EX: (1, 10, 1, 10, 0, 100, 0, 100, 1, 4)) )  # for vne request

c. Run Vne.py after doing any modification.


S3 In Grpah_extraction.py:

a. In graph.Parameters function we set Physical network resources like BandWidth(1,n) ,CRB(CPU)(1,10), Location(0,100),Delay(1,4). Ex: (10000, 500000, 10000, 500000, 0, 100, 0, 100, 1, 1)
b. In get_graphs function mention the pickle file relates to physical network which available in the folder P3_ALIB_MASTER.

EX:
 os.path.join(
            os.path.dirname(current),
            "P3_ALIB_MASTER",
            "input",
            "senario_RedBestel.pickle",)

c. Run Grpah_extraction.py after doing any modification.

S4. a input.pickle file is created and it is having all input parameters for both physical network and Virtual network request parameeters.


S5. Graph.py Contain the various parameters used in input picke file.


S6. Use above pickle file to solve the VNE problem.
